# structuraldesign
Design of  column using 
This code takes in the input data such as the column dimensions, grade of concrete and steel, axial load on the column, height of the building,and the zone factor for earthquake load calculations. 
It then calculates the design parameters and earthquake loads using relevant equations from IS code. 
Finally, it checks the safety of the column under both axial and earthquake loads and the slenderness ratio of the column.
The output will indicate if the column is safe or not under the given conditions.
